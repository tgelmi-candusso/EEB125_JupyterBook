# # Final Project Proposal
# 
# ## Due date: March 20, 23:59
# 
# ### Submission details to follow
# 
# ## Instructions
# 
# - Each group must submit a project proposal.  Your TA is aiming to give your group feedback within one week of submission.
# 
# 
# - The goal of the proposal is not to work out every detail around your group's presentation plans and analysis, but to ensure that the question is feasible and that each group has a work plan.  
# 
# 
# - Another goal is for the teaching team to be able to give your group feedback with enough time to incorporate the feedback.  Although, we view this as the start of the conversation between your group and your TA.
# 
# 
# - Each member should read the [instructions for the final project](EEB125posterpresentation.ipynb).
#
