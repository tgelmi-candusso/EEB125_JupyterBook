    "## Purpose of Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first weekly homework assignment! You are encouraged to refer to lecture content and liberally use course resources such as the discussion board and office hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homeworks build off of content explored in lecture and in lab and give you an opportunity to practice with the material. Homeworks will contain tasks that focus on tools and knowledge described in lecture and lab that week. Data science knowledge is often cumulative, and you will be asked to refer to prior weeks' content (such as loading in datasets, which is something you're going to do a lot of in this course).\n",
    "\n",
    "Homeworks may also be continuations of the shorter labs done during that week, and will feature a relatively greater emphasis on application of tools, inquiry of concepts, and interpretation of your data science findings. Homeworks will feature a mix of coding and written response questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "All homeworks will take place in a Jupyter notebook (like this one). When you are done, you will download this notebook and submit it to MarkUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "[Part 1](#Part-1:-Python) will teach you more about Python.  There are no questions in this part to hand in.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Questions to Submit](#Questions-to-Submit) has questions that you will answer in a Jupyter notebook that you create.  Instructions on how to name your Jupyter notebook are in the [Creating your notebook section](#Creating-your-notebook) below.  This section contains the homework questions that you will submit via MarkUs.  The instructions for submitting to Markus are in the [Submitting your work section](#Submitting-your-work)."

    "`int` is short for _integer_, and type `int` consists of all whole numbers, both positive and negative, including `0`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `int`/`float` distinction is important because some operations in Python can only be done using a specific type of number (`int` or `float`). Also, the type you use will depend on the context. For example, if we were to write a program that counts the number of students enrolled in a lecture, we would use an `int` data type (we can't have half students!), and if we wanted an average we would probably want to use a `float`."
