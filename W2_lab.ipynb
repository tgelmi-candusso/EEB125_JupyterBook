    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will have your first hands-on opportunity to work with dataframes. Specifically, you will complete a few simple tasks including creating a `dict` and `dataframe` in pandas from data in the format of a markdown table provided below. Furthermore, you will extract (select) specific variables (columns), and subset (filter) observations (rows) on position-based (implicit) and boolean (explicit) conditions.\n",

    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will be asked to manipulate data pertaining to students' assignment, midterm, final assessment grades. It contains 4 rows pertaining to 4 different students, and 4 columns, pertaining to student ID, assignment, midterm and final assessment grade, in that order. The data has been recorded as below: \n",
    "\n",
    "| Student ID | Assignment | Midterm | Final |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 100 | 80 | 70 | 60 |\n",
    "| 101 | 85 | 80 | 70 |\n",
    "| 102 | 85 | 70 | 80 |\n",
    "| 103 | 90 | 85 | 90 |\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset itself is fake, but might closely imitate or reflect how real data might also be represented. We call these types of datasets 'toy datasets'. They are meant to illustrate and verify the behaviour of different data science techniques, which is what we'll be doing today!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, these labs are meant to be a low-stakes environment to practice and apply skills learned in lecture. You are encouraged to refer to lecture content, work with your peers, and ask the lab TAs for help!"
